JBoss 7 vs JBoss 8 and the Jakarta Namespace
JBoss 7 is based on Java EE 6/7 and uses the old javax.* namespace.

JBoss EAP 8 (and WildFly 28+) supports Jakarta EE 9+, which means it uses the jakarta.* namespace.

What does this mean for your application deployment?
If you upgrade your application to use Spring Boot 3.x (which requires jakarta.*), you must deploy it on a JBoss version that supports Jakarta EE 9 namespaces, i.e., JBoss EAP 8 or later.

Deploying an app using jakarta. APIs on JBoss 7 will fail* because JBoss 7’s classloader and modules only recognize javax.* APIs.

JBoss 8 fully supports Jakarta EE 9, so it’s compatible with the namespace changes in your Spring Boot 3.x app.
